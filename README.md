The Banking Ui LightCode

Framework: - Talwindcss

making:- 
             There are many sections that dived with so many different visual experiences. There
             is a navbar with a hovering effect .
             The app is fully responsive it can open the smallest to largest screen properly.
             There I use an sm for small screen md for mid-screen lg for a large screen to get 
             ui responsive.
             The code will not repeat the same thing repeatedly and I follow the rule of Dry 
             and first, the screen make for mobile devices then for desktops.
             It takes 3-4 hrs to complete a website. It has a card flip section when we preen 
             the flip button card flip and back side of the card is visible.
             Also,  I use a little bit Java script so when we click on an image there a border 
             to that image occurs and a down para gets there with that image's human name.
             For that I take first I make that text display none. 
             then after I make it display block when user-test and active text is at a time.
             after clicking of id of that i make a function of ShowReview on click of face of 
             image accourding to get that specific image and a text i use a loop.
             then there toogle button section where after click om it all the card get rotate 
             180 deg.
             To not repeat a class i use add all the same class in input.css section by using 
             class name.
             i add a color which i need for a project in telwind css config in module export 
             section.
	     Rest there i give a link to see my Project.
             Its so simple and easy to use this app or a ui by user.
